# 🚀 Day 13 of JavaScript Journey
Topics Covered:

JSON

Callback Queue

Microtask Queue

💡 What I Learned Today:

Understood how JavaScript handles asynchronous operations.

Explored the difference between the callback queue and the microtask queue, and how the event loop decides which task runs first.

Learned how asynchronous behavior affects code execution order.

🧑‍💻 Code Practice:

Converted data using JSON.parse() and JSON.stringify().

Practiced how JSON helps in serializing and deserializing data.

Implemented deep copy using JSON methods.

🔁 Revision:

Reinforced understanding of queues and event loop flow.

Re-implemented deep copying using JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse() to solidify the concept.
